# New Tests for DAG Operation Logging

This document describes the new test files added to test the DAG operation logging functionality.

## Tests Added

### 1. `test_dag_operation_logging.py`

This file contains comprehensive tests for the core DAG operation logging functionality:

#### Operation Probabilities Tests
- `test_get_op_probabilities()` - Tests that operation probabilities are correctly computed and returned
- `test_get_op_probabilities_no_forward_pass()` - Tests behavior when no forward pass has been executed
- `test_op_logits_to_probabilities_consistency()` - Verifies that probabilities match what's computed from logits

#### Operation Logits Tests  
- `test_get_op_logits_dict()` - Tests that operation logits are correctly returned
- Verifies all operations have corresponding logit values

#### Gradient Tracking Tests
- `test_operation_gradient_capture()` - Tests that operation gradients are correctly captured
- `test_gradient_computation_consistency()` - Tests that gradients are reasonable across forward/backward passes
- `test_extra_vals_includes_all_logging_info()` - Verifies that `extra_vals()` includes entropy and gradient information

#### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- `test_logging_with_no_dag_depth()` - Tests behavior when `dag_depth=0` (no DAG)
- `test_logging_after_multiple_forward_passes()` - Tests logging across multiple forward passes
- `test_gradient_tracking_with_grad_context()` - Tests gradient tracking with `torch.no_grad()`

#### Integration Tests
- `test_logging_integration_training_scenario()` - Tests logging in a training-like scenario with multiple batches

### 2. `test_training_logging_integration.py`

This file contains integration tests for the training loop functionality:

#### Text Generation Tests
- `test_training_loop_text_generation_integration()` - Tests that text generation works correctly during training
- Uses mock encode/decode functions to test generation pipeline

#### Training Step Integration
- `test_operation_logging_during_training_step()` - Tests that all logging works correctly during a simulated training step
- Verifies wandb-compatible logging format
- Tests data serialization for JSON compatibility

#### Console Output Tests
- `test_console_logging_format()` - Tests console logging format matches expected output
- Verifies proper formatting of operation names and values

## Test Coverage

The tests cover:

✅ **Operation Probabilities**: Computation, formatting, and validation  
✅ **Operation Logits**: Raw logit values and consistency with probabilities  
✅ **Gradient Tracking**: Capture of operation-specific gradients  
✅ **Text Generation**: Integration with training loop  
✅ **Console Logging**: Proper formatting for human-readable output  
✅ **Wandb Integration**: JSON-serializable data for logging  
✅ **Error Handling**: Edge cases and graceful degradation  
✅ **Training Integration**: Multi-batch training scenario simulation  

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run DAG operation logging tests
python -m pytest tests/test_dag_operation_logging.py -v

# Run training integration tests  
python -m pytest tests/test_training_logging_integration.py -v

# Run both test suites
python -m pytest tests/test_dag_operation_logging.py tests/test_training_logging_integration.py -v
```

## Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see:
- 11 tests passing in `test_dag_operation_logging.py`
- 3 tests passing in `test_training_logging_integration.py`
- Total: 14 tests passing

These tests ensure that the new DAG operation logging functionality works correctly and integrates properly with the training pipeline.
